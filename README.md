# Jessica Casey (210169210) - CSC3094 Project
This project was created as part of my dissertation (module code CSC3094) at
Newcastle University. It is a turn-based combat game played between two AI
agents, with each agent simulating one of four algorithms:
1. State machine
2. Goal oriented action planning
3. Alpha-beta pruning
4. Markov decision process

The project aims to identify which of the above algorithms is the most suitable
for finding the optimal strategy at runtime.
